Compiler Overview
-

The idea behind this coffeescript built compiler is to compile quick sites on the fly. It relies on a layout.jade file in the current directory, which loads the proper templates in as we need them. 

A data object is created using modules of other coffeescript literals. Each layout uses the its own scoped data. For now the scope is not fixed but working on this soon in next update.
